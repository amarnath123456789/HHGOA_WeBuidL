🚀 EtherScore - Decentralized Credit Scoring dApp 🛡️
Overview 🌐
Our Decentralized Credit Scoring dApp provides a secure, privacy-preserving alternative to traditional credit scoring. By leveraging blockchain technology, it allows users to utilize their digital assets—such as USDT balances, NFT holdings, and ENS tokens—for accurate credit assessments. All data is processed using Nada AI’s blind computation to ensure user privacy and security. 🔒

Features ✨
🔗 Decentralized Data Fetching: Query and analyze blockchain-based assets directly from your wallet using The Graph Protocol.
🛡️ Privacy-Preserving Computation: Data is processed securely using Nada AI's blind computation, ensuring that personal financial information remains confidential.
⚖️ Fair Credit Assessment: Provides an unbiased credit score based on actual blockchain holdings, accessible to anyone, regardless of traditional credit history.
Problem Solved 🛠️
Traditional credit scoring systems are often intrusive, centralized, and prone to data breaches. Many individuals in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space lack traditional credit histories, limiting their access to financial services. Our dApp solves these issues by offering a decentralized, secure, and privacy-respecting alternative for credit assessments.

Use Cases 🎯
👥 For Individuals: Secure access to loans or financial services using blockchain holdings as the basis for creditworthiness.
🏦 For Financial Institutions: A transparent and reliable way to assess the creditworthiness of individuals in the DeFi space without intrusive data collection.
Architecture 🏗️
📊 Data Querying with The Graph Protocol:

Users input their wallet address.
The dApp queries relevant data from The Graph Protocol, including USDT balances, NFT holdings, and ENS tokens.
🔒 Privacy-Preserving Computation with Nada AI:

The fetched data is passed to Nada AI’s blind computation model.
The AI processes the data securely, generating a credit score without exposing sensitive information.
📈 Credit Score Generation:

The dApp outputs a credit score based on the processed blockchain data.
Users can use this score to access various financial services.

Challenges We Faced 🧩
One significant challenge was ensuring the privacy of user data while performing accurate credit scoring. Blockchain data is sensitive, and we needed to analyze it without exposing personal details. We overcame this by integrating Nada AI’s blind computation, which allowed us to process data securely without compromising privacy.

Another challenge was efficiently querying and processing data using The Graph Protocol. To address this, we fine-tuned our GraphQL queries and optimized our subgraphs for better performance, ensuring that the data was fetched accurately and efficiently.

Future Enhancements 🚀
📈 Integration with more blockchain assets: Expanding the range of assets that can be used for credit scoring.
🤖 Improved AI Models: Enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the credit scoring algorithm with more advanced AI models.
📱 Mobile Application: Developing a mobile version of the dApp for easier access.
